            <p>
                The Community Flavor Pack is the most downloaded CK3 mod on the steam workshop, and for good reason. This mod adds loads of different items of clothing, crowns, and hairstyles into the game. With each appearing naturally in the culture groups/religions they are for. This is an amazing mod which helps make the different characters have unique looks, rather then having the same outfits get repeated.

            <h3> LotR: Realms in Exile </h3>

            <p>
                Realms in Exile takes a unique approach to mod development. Rather then Producing a full map with little depth this mod has only a small section of the map filled. However, this has allowed the devs to create a large amount of decisions and events for you to experience. What they have done already is top quality and I am excited to see where it goes.

            <h3> Sunset Invasion </h3>

            <p>
                Sunset Invasion is a reimagining of the CK2 DLC of the same name. Remade for CK3. With new graphics for units and buildings, as well as new clothing for the Aztec invaders, what was considered one of the worst DLC is now one of the best mods. With the the author announcing plans to take the mod further then the DLC ever went, this mods potential is near limitless.
