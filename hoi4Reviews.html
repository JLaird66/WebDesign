            <h3> Kaiserreich </h3>

            <p>
                "What if Germany won WW1" is the main premise behind this mod, and it executes this premise flawlessly. Almost every nation in the game has a focus tree, with multiple paths they can choose to go down. From a KKK led America to a restored Russian Empire, this mod has a wealth of interesting paths to play.

            <h3> Road to 56 </h3>
            <img style = "height:50%; width:50%" src = "images/RT56.jpg" alt="56">
            <p>
                Less of a mod itself and more a collection of many different mods rolled into one, RT56 is one of the largest mods for HOI4 without being a total conversion. With new technology expanding to 1956 (hence the name), to new focus trees for all of the large nations and quite a few of the smaller ones, it is my opinion that everyone should try it out at least once.

            <h3> The New Order </h3>
            <img style = "height:50%; width:50%" src = "images/TNO.png" alt="new order">
            <p>
                One of the most terrifying premises for a mod I have ever seen, TNO answers the question of "what would the world look like if Germany won WW2", and the answer is terrifying. In a world where nuclear war is an ever present threat, when everything is slowly breaking down, the tagline "last days of Europe" is entirely accurate. With many different paths for each of the major powers at the start, you have your pick of the leaders of this dark alternative. Of course, if you want to truly observe the true depths of the horror this mod can provide, play as Burgundy, its dark from the start and just gets worse.
