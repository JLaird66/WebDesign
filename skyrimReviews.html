            <h3> Helgen Reborn </h3>

            <p>
                Helgen Reborn is a fully voiced quest mod based around rebuilding the titular village of Helgen. Available from the beginning of the game you are tasked with helping to rebuild the village. In the process you shall have to deal with dragons, daedra and thalmor in your quest. You are given the choice to get aid from the imperials or the stormcloaks, or (as the mod author suggests) remain independent of both factions. You even get a fully furnished player home with an updating trophy room that will create new statues as you continue through the main quest and certain side quests. This mod is a fun little diversion from the main quest for you to complete as you wish.

            <h3> The Forgotten City </h3>
            <img style = "height:50%; width:50%" src="images/Forgotten%20City.jpg" alt="forgottenCity">
            <p>
                The Forgotten City is one of the most successful quest adding mods for Skyrim. It is practically a game in and of itself (and is in fact being made into a game). The premise for it is that an ancient hidden city was destroyed due to a crime committed, and the creators of the city decided that everyone would be punished for the crimes of the few. This 6 hour questline sees you repeating the same events over and over as you try to prevent the destruction of the city, if you succeed or fail is up to you, your actions decide the fate of each and every person you meet. With brilliant voice acting and an award winning script, this is one of my favourite mods for Skyrim ever.

            <h3> SkyUI </h3>
            <img style = "height:50%; width:50%" src="images/SkyUI%20Logo.png" alt="SkyUI">
            <p>
                SkyUI is the my preferred UI mod for Skyrim. It is better then the vanilla system in every way. From allowing you to search for specific items in your inventory, to your ability to sort by weight, type, value, or a mix of other variables. It makes dealling with a large inventory so much simpler. No more having to search through endless items to find the one you want. Add in the built in mod configuration menu and this mod is almost a requirement for any modded Skyrim game.
